meemomi is a camera-based virtual piano interface that lets users play music using printed A4 paper templates. Powered by a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and finger tracking, it detects real-time interactions on paper "keys" and plays corresponding piano soundsâ€”making music creation accessible without physical instruments.



### MEEMOMI 2.0 IS COMING OUT SOON TO PLAYSTORE :)
